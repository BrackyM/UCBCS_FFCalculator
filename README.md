# Group 3 | UCBCS_FFCalculator | README

What motivated us to create this project is that all of us are huge NFL fans. We wanted to develop a web app that correlates to our favorite sport.
This drove us to collaborate and apply our knowledge to this project. Overall experience was challenging and rewarding at the same time. 
The 3 languages we have used for this project are HTML, Javascript, JSON, and CSS. We also used a free open-source framework called Bulma.

* Sky and Braxton were in charge of building and pulling fantasy league data to javascript so that users

* Khiem and Ish were in charge of live twitter feeds where users can check up on latest nfl news for their fantasy league. 


Group 3 Members:
